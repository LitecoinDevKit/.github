Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK) is a library that allows you to seamlessly build cross-platform Bitcoin wallets without worrying about bitcoin internals.

Learn the simplest way to integrate Bitcoin wallet features into any application at [bitcoindevkit.org](https://bitcoindevkit.org/).

### ðŸ”¨ Contributing to the ecosystem
Our team maintains [bdk](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk) which is the core library, while also maintaining a number of other open source projects like:
 - [BDK CLI](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-cli) - A CLI wallet library and REPL tool to demo and test the BDK library
 - [BDK FFI](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-ffi) - A foreign language bindings generator for BDK (experimental)
 - [BDK Documentation](https://bitcoindevkit.org/) - Our open source documentation
